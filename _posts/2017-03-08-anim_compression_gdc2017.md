title: "Animation Compression: GDC 2017 Presentation"
---
In early 2016 I had the opportunity to write a novel animation compression algorithm for [Eidos Montreal](https://eidosmontreal.com/en) as part of the game engine previously used by [Rise of the Tomb Raider (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider). Later in February 2017, I had the pleasure to present it at the [Game Developers Conference (GDC)](http://www.gdconf.com/).

The slides for the presentation can be found [here](/public/simple_and_powerful_animation_compression_gdc2017.pdf) and a blog post detailing the technique can be found [here]({% post_url 2017-03-12-anim_compression_advanced_quantization %}).
