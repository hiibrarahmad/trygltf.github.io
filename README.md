# ObjViewer

The library to display obj- and mtl-files to display them including a skybox with WebGL and [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Basic Usage

 1. `new ObjViewer(THREE, canvas, files, callbacks)` - Construct an instance.
 2. `Objviewer.load()` - Download the files and load them into the world.
 3. `ObjViewer.requestPointerLock.bind(ObjViewer)` - Request a pointerlock to movein the world.
 4. `ObjViewer.startAnimation()` - Start the animation.
 5. `ObjViewer.stopAnimation()` - Stop the animation. (Not needed if an animation pause is not wanted (which it usually isn't)).
